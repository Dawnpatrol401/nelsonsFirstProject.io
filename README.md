# tts_weekOne_weekend
This is my first project.

My goal with this was to create a fake console on the page that you could show or hide and that is scrollable.  I wanted to have events get logged into the console.  I started with a couple of mouse over events.

In the future I want to add some more events. 
Have the events logged into the top of the list rather than the bottom.
Make the code way more DRY
