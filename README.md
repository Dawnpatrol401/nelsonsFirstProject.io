# Hideable Console on Page
Contributor: [Christopher Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisnelson222)

I am learning how to manipulate the DOM with javascript.  My goal for this project was to do the following:
* Create a form on the page that will create events.
* Create a simulated console at the bottom of the page that can be hidden.
* Use that console to show events taking place, similar to if I was to do a console log.
* I used an unordered list to create the events.

In the future I would like to:
* Add some more events. 
* Have the events logged into the top of the list rather than the bottom.
* Make the code more DRY
